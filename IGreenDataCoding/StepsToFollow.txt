1) Make sure you have the latest Visual Studio with version .Net 8
2) Download the project from Github 
3) Go to the path "GreenDataRobo\bin\Debug\net6.0"
4) If you want to give commands from file, open and update the file "InputFile.txt".
5) Save the file and close.
6) Run the file "GreenDataRobo.exe"
7) Follow the on screen commands.


Testing :

Valid Commands -
  - PLACE X,Y,F
  - MOVE
  - LEFT
  - RIGHT
  - REPORT

where 
F - NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST
X - 0,1,2,3,4
Y - 0,1,2,3,4


1) Once you run the application, you can see from the commands need to input 
	- File
	- Commands
2) Suppose you selected File
3) Make sure you updated all the commands in the file - "GreenDataRobo\bin\Debug\net6.0\InputFile.txt" and properly closed.
4) Input is casesensitive, 's' and 'S' are different. 
4) Now you seleced F and press Enter
5) You can see the output (if you have REPORT in your file)
6) If you want to continue with other set of commands, then open the above file and update and close it properly. Make sure to save your changes.
7) Now as mentioned on screen press any key (except 'N') and press Enter.
8) From step 5 it is repeated again.
9) If you want to change the input command press 'N' at stage 7.
10) Now press 'C' and press Enter
11) You can see - At any point of time, if you want to goto Home, press - 'H'
12) Now you can give any valid commands or Invalid Commands 
13) The first valid command to the robot is a PLACE command, after that, 
	any sequence of commands may be issued, in any order, including another PLACE command. 
	The application should discard all commands in the sequence until a valid PLACE command has been executed.

14) Few Test Samples I shared below

15) In the same way you can play with this.
